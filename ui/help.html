                    The decision to make a change is rarely an easy one for someone with an eating disorder. If the eating disorder has left them malnourished, it can distort the way they think—about their body, the world around them, even your motivations for trying to help. Bombarding them with dire warnings about the health consequences of their eating disorder or trying to bully them into eating normally probably won't work. Eating disorders often fill an important role in the person's life—a way to cope with unpleasant emotions—so the allure can be strong. Since you may be met with defensiveness or denial, you'll need to tread carefully when broaching the subject.

                    <h4>Pick a good time</h4>
                    <p>
                        Choose a time when you can speak to the person in private without distractions or constraints. You don't want to have to stop in the middle of the conversation because of other obligations! It's also important to have the conversation at a time of emotional calm. Don't try to have this conversation right after a blow up.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Explain why you're concerned.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Be careful to avoid lecturing or criticizing, as this will only make your loved one defensive. Instead, refer to specific situations and behaviors you've noticed, and why they worry you. Your goal at this point is not to offer solutions, but to express your concerns about the person's health, how you much you love them, and your desire to help.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Be prepared for denial and resistance
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        There's a good chance your loved one may deny having an eating disorder or become angry and defensive. If this happens, try to remain calm, focused, and respectful. Remember that this conversation likely feels very threatening to someone with an eating disorder. Don't take it personally.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Ask if the person has reasons for wanting to change
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Even if your loved one lacks the desire to change for themselves, they may want to change for other reasons: to please someone they love, to return to school or work, for example. All that really matters is that they are willing to seek help.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Be patient and supportive
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Don't give up if the person shuts you down at first. It may take some time before they're willing to open up and admit to having a problem. The important thing is opening up the lines of communication. If they are willing to talk, listen without judgment, no matter how out of touch they may sound. Make it clear that you care, that you believe in them, and that you'll be there in whatever way they need, whenever they're ready.

                    Knowing what to say or what not to say to a loved one with an eating disorder matters because saying the wrong thing, even if well-intentioned, can trigger behaviors and coping mechanisms like restricting, binging, or purging.

                <h4>
                    Avoid ultimatums
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Unless you're dealing with an underage child, you can't force someone into treatment. The decision to change must come from them. Ultimatums merely add pressure and promote more secrecy and denial.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Avoid commenting on appearance or weight
                </h4>
                <p>
                    People with eating disorders are already overly focused on their bodies. Even assurances that they're not fat play into their preoccupation with being thin. Instead, steer the conversation to their feelings. Why are they afraid of being fat? What do they think they'll achieve by being thin?
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Avoid shaming and blaming
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Steer clear of accusatory “you” statements like, “You just need to eat!” Or, “You're hurting yourself for no reason.” Use “I” statements instead. For example: “I find it hard to watch you wasting away.” Or, “I'm scared when I hear you throwing up.”
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Avoid giving simple solutions
                </h4>
                <p>
                    For example, “All you have to do is accept yourself.” Eating disorders are complex problems. If it were that easy, your loved one wouldn't be suffering. 
                </p>
